Scrapes comments from 12 different Reddit threads covering peoples' reasons for purchasing NASA merch. Categorizes into the following reasons: "Interest in space and NASA's work", "Trending or Cool Clothing/Logo", "Symbol of US Accomplishments in Space Discovery/Patriotism", "Cheap and Conveniently Located Clothing Stores", "Other". This project is part of my work as a strategy consultant under the creative director of NASA, David Rager, to creatively evaluate NASAâ€™s brand value and propose growth strategy for merchandise presence.
